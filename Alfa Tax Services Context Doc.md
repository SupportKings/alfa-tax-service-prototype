# **Context for Toni/David/Luka**

* Tax, bookkeeping, payroll, and business consulting firm — 17 years in business, Central Time Zone (San Antonio)  
* 500 clients total — \~20 monthly recurring (bookkeeping), the rest are quarterly or annual (tax)  
* Taxes are 70% of the business — individual and business returns  
* Pricing ranges from $350 (simple W2) to $10-30K/yr (CFO advisory / financial management packages)  
* One-time offers include CFO advisory ($2,500), tax plan ($5,000), business setup/consultation ($500), and hourly advisory ($150/hr individual, $250/hr business)  
* Bookkeeping is monthly/quarterly/annually (minimum $2,500/yr) and includes payroll setup, basic advisory  
* Main lead source is referrals — currently turning people away  
* Kathy Alfaro is the owner/operator with HEAVY key man risk — she is the bottleneck on tax return reviews, client calls, advisory, and most operational decisions  
* She wants to scale the advisory/financial management offer — this is the highest-value service and where Kathy wants to grow  
* ICP: organized clients with fast response times — she does NOT want to work with slow, disorganized clients  
* Uses Tax Dome (client comms, doc management, pipeline), ATX (tax prep — no integration with Tax Dome), QBO (bookkeeping), Gusto/ADP (payroll), Alavara (sales tax), WhatsApp (internal comms)

# **Current Situation**

## **Business Model & Revenue**

* Revenue is heavily weighted toward tax (70%) with bookkeeping, payroll, and advisory making up the rest  
* Tax returns range from $350 (simple W2) up to complex business filings; bookkeeping starts at $2,500/yr minimum  
* Advisory is the offer Kathy wants to scale — one-time fees of $2,500-$5,000, or $10-30K/yr for full financial management  
* 500 total clients with \~20 monthly recurring bookkeeping clients, the rest quarterly or annual tax clients  
* Currently referral-driven and turning people away — demand exceeds capacity

## **Team Structure & Ops**

* Kathy Alfaro (owner) — reviews all returns, handles advisory, manages client relationships, makes all operational decisions  
* Carmen (front desk, bilingual — critical for San Antonio market), Jacob (data entry clerk — enters data into ATX), Carina (junior tax accountant), Johnathan (tax accountant / tax prep)  
* Offshore: DJ's team for tax returns (requires signed authorization form; goal is to push more work here and remove Kathy from review); Simiran's offshore accounting team for bookkeeping (categorization, reconciliation, QBO setup, chart of accounts, end-of-year entries)  
* 3rd party: Precise Financial (Spanish-speaking accountant), temp tax workers, CPAs  
* Office has 3 people at once, costs $1,400/mo; Kathy works from home office  
* Internal comms happen over WhatsApp with accountants, bookkeepers, and foreign clients  
* Heavy key man risk — everything flows through Kathy's brain

## **Service Delivery & Process**

* Tax returns go through: intake → Tax Dome setup → data entry into ATX (manual copy/paste) → preparer review → deduction check → Kathy final review → client review call → invoice → e-file  
* Bookkeeping: onboarding → QBO setup / review chart of accounts → monthly categorization & reconciliation → send uncategorized transaction list → finalize → point client to dashboard  
* Advisory: review tax returns and financials → check industry averages → find recommendations → build presentation → deliver on call  
* Business formation: name search → secretary of state filing → EIN request → wait for state tax ID → store key information  
* Intake requests come from Tax Dome, email, phone, WhatsApp, and website — no central triage; status lives in Kathy's head

# **Business Goals**

* Remove Kathy as the bottleneck on tax return reviews by building a consistent QA process the team can execute  
* Create a single source of truth for all client file statuses, deadlines, and request tracking (currently in Kathy's brain)  
* Scale the advisory/financial management offer — this is the highest-value service and where Kathy wants to grow  
* Digitize and streamline the tax intake process to eliminate paper-based information loss during busy seasons  
* Eliminate manual data entry between Tax Dome and ATX through integration or automation  
* Flag client quality (good vs. bad) based on response times and communication patterns to protect ICP standards

# **What's Stopping Us From Getting There**

## **Barrier 1: Kathy Is the Bottleneck on Everything**

* **Challenge:** Kathy does final review on every tax return, handles all client review calls, manages advisory, makes all operational decisions, and is the only person who knows the full status of every client file  
* **Impact:** The business cannot scale beyond Kathy's personal capacity; the team lacks confidence to act independently; revenue is capped by one person's time  
* **Risk:** Heavy key man risk — if Kathy is unavailable, the entire operation stalls; the advisory offer she wants to scale requires the most Kathy-time of any service

## **Barrier 2: No Central Source of Truth — Status Lives in Kathy's Brain**

* **Challenge:** Client file statuses, request intake, deadlines, and account logins are tracked mentally or across disconnected systems (Tax Dome, QBO, ATX, WhatsApp, email, phone, website); no single view of "is everything on track"  
* **Impact:** During busy season, files get dropped off and status is unknown until they make it into Tax Dome; people are panicky; stale intakes go unnoticed; requests from 5+ channels are not triaged  
* **Risk:** Missed deadlines, lost client information (especially from paper intake), compliance failures, and inability to answer "what is the status of this client" without asking Kathy

## **Barrier 3: Manual Processes and Disconnected Systems**

* **Challenge:** Tax Dome and ATX don't integrate, requiring Jacob to manually copy-paste client data; paper intake forms during busy season lose information; checks and bulk orders require manual review; no OCR or automation for categorization  
* **Impact:** Data entry is a pure time cost with no value-add; during tax season with 10 walk-ins at once, information falls through the cracks; bookkeeping categorization is slower than it needs to be  
* **Risk:** Human error in data transfer between systems; lost revenue from unbilled work that was never tracked; scaling the client base will multiply these manual costs linearly

# **Key Question**

How can Alfa Tax Services automate and standardize their operations to:

1. Remove Kathy as the single point of failure by creating a consistent QA process and centralized system the team can execute independently  
2. Build a single source of truth for all client statuses, deadlines, and requests so nothing falls through the cracks during tax season  
3. Eliminate manual data transfer and paper-based intake to free capacity for scaling the high-value advisory offer

**Subsystem Analysis**

## **Tax Intake & Onboarding (In-Person)**

### **Current Situation**

* Walk-in clients bring paper documents; during busy season 10+ files can be dropped off at once with no visibility into their status until they're entered into Tax Dome  
* Information is collected on paper forms (engagement form, questionnaire, consent form) that sometimes don't get entered or updated in Tax Dome, especially when clients are in a rush  
* Deposit collection, document scanning, and follow-up for missing documents are all manual — pending clients have no visible status

### **Improvement Opportunities**

* Digital version of intake forms via tablet to check clients in and capture information directly into the system (SSOT) — eliminates paper loss  
* During busy seasons, create real-time status tracking for dropped-off files so the team knows where each one stands before it hits Tax Dome  
* Biggest issue is information lost on pieces of paper — ensure every intake flows into a single digital system immediately

### **Key KPIs & Dashboards**

* **KPIs:** Intake-to-Tax Dome entry time, percentage of intakes with complete documentation at first visit, number of stale/pending intakes  
* **Dashboards:** Real-time intake status board (filed, canceled, completed, extended, blocked); pending client follow-up queue

## **Tax Intake & Onboarding (Virtual)**

### **Current Situation**

* Virtual clients are invited to Tax Dome to fill out engagement forms, questionnaires, and consent forms; files are requested through the portal  
* Older clients don't use Tax Dome and instead call in, creating a parallel manual process  
* Pending clients waiting on documents (e.g., brokerage packages that don't arrive until March) need manual follow-up with no centralized tracking

### **Improvement Opportunities**

* Centralized tracking of virtual intake status so pending/stale intakes are visible and follow-ups are automated  
* Consistent digital flow regardless of whether client is tech-savvy or not — reduce reliance on phone-based intake for older clients

### **Key KPIs & Dashboards**

* **KPIs:** Organizer completion rate, average days from invitation to "organizer completed," deposit payment rate  
* **Dashboards:** Virtual intake pipeline (invited → forms submitted → organizer completed → deposit paid → ready for prep)

## **Tax Preparation & Filing**

### **Current Situation**

* Jacob manually copies data from Tax Dome into ATX because the systems don't integrate; ATX updates annually with new tax laws and carries the tax code  
* Tax preparers review data, manually search for deduction opportunities (ATX catches some but not all), and update the return; Kathy always does final review and always finds improvements  
* Client review calls are done by Kathy, even for simple returns — she also handles invoicing, e-filing, and pays for additional per-filing insurance (audit protection, IRS defense, identity theft)

### **Improvement Opportunities**

* Automate the data transfer from Tax Dome to ATX (or equivalent) to eliminate manual copy-paste  
* AI scan to confirm what information has been received vs. what's still missing ("They said they had 2 jobs but only gave 1 W2")  
* AI helper tool to find possible deduction opportunities — ATX finds some but the preparer has to find the rest manually  
* Solve for consistent high-quality QA to mirror Kathy's review — this is the single biggest unlock to remove her as the bottleneck  
* Tag clients by complexity level so someone other than Kathy can handle the simple review calls

### **Key KPIs & Dashboards**

* **KPIs:** Average data entry time per return, number of deductions/opportunities found per return, Kathy review turnaround time, percentage of returns that pass QA without Kathy  
* **Dashboards:** Tax return pipeline (data entry → preparer review → manager review → client review → filed); returns pending Kathy review

## **Bookkeeping Onboarding**

### **Current Situation**

* Bookkeeping clients are typically existing tax customers; onboarding includes collecting legal formation documents, compliance IDs, and connecting bank accounts to QBO  
* If the client already has QBO, the team reviews their chart of accounts and finds issues — this review/fixing process can take up to 2 years for messy books  
* Payroll setup goes through Gusto (or reviewing existing ADP setup); catch-up work varies by business

### **Improvement Opportunities**

* AI-guided onboarding flow for each client: "How many bank accounts do you have?", which type of org, trained on the types of docs needed to build a custom quote, ensures answers for each key question  
* Client global "caught up" view for bookkeeping so there's visibility into which clients are fully onboarded vs. still in catch-up

### **Key KPIs & Dashboards**

* **KPIs:** Days from signed engagement to "caught up" status, number of open onboarding issues per client, percentage of clients with complete QBO setup  
* **Dashboards:** Bookkeeping onboarding pipeline; client "caught up" status view

## **Bookkeeping Recurring (Monthly Close)**

### **Current Situation**

* Monthly cycle: review and categorize each transaction (some auto-categorized via QBO text matching), split transactions as needed (loans, payroll, bulk orders), send client an Excel file of uncategorized/receipt-missing transactions, finalize reconciliation, point client to QBO dashboard  
* Manual review required for checks, Amazon orders, bulk orders, and combo orders; small clients close monthly, bigger clients do weekly categorization (50+ transactions/week)  
* Client requests come in ad hoc to Kathy — "we're not going to make payroll," "want to set up healthcare," divorce/car purchase questions — especially heavy during tax season

### **Improvement Opportunities**

* OCR for checks to try and auto-categorize — reduce manual review burden  
* Track the volume of transactions per client (small, medium, large) — use that data for quoting as well as determining frequency of transaction categorization  
* Parse transactions and flag chart of accounts issues automatically (e.g., if a purchase is of a certain type, it implies other account classifications)

### **Key KPIs & Dashboards**

* **KPIs:** Transactions categorized per hour, percentage auto-categorized vs. manual, average days to close per client, uncategorized transaction count per client  
* **Dashboards:** Monthly close status by client; transaction volume trends; uncategorized items requiring client response

## **Advisory & Tax Planning**

### **Current Situation**

* Kathy reviews 2 years of tax returns and financial statements, checks industry averages, reviews profit/loss, searches for cash flow issues, and identifies tax recommendations based on patterns  
* She builds a presentation and delivers it on a call; 80% of advisory clients she will NOT offer implementation because they're not a good fit  
* "If I can't save you what you pay me, you get your money back" — this is the offer she wants to scale most

### **Improvement Opportunities**

* AI model / smart form to help with analyzing companies — get the first principles of tax recommendations then use a skill for "tax return analysis" consulting  
* Could tie in with tax planning sites — get recommendations based on previous returns automatically  
* Specific markdown skill of tax return analysis: account for legal structure, apply first principles of tax return analysis

### **Key KPIs & Dashboards**

* **KPIs:** Revenue per advisory engagement, percentage of advisory clients who convert to implementation, savings identified per client  
* **Dashboards:** Advisory pipeline (inquiry → review → presentation → delivered); implementation conversion rate

## **Business Formation & Structuring**

### **Current Situation**

* Client contacts Kathy wanting to form an LLC; she sends an email template to gather info (name, address per member), completes name search, submits to secretary of state, waits for approval (1-10 days), requests EIN (one per day per account), waits for state tax ID to come in the mail  
* Key information (EIN, business name, formation date, certificate) must be stored because it's needed for banking, taxes, DUNS number, government contracting  
* Always a $500 one-time fee; restructuring may also be required

### **Improvement Opportunities**

* Global search for EIN, business name — pop up the main client profile instantly

### **Key KPIs & Dashboards**

* **KPIs:** Days from engagement to formation complete, EIN requests pending, state filings pending  
* **Dashboards:** Business formation pipeline (name search → state filing → EIN → state tax ID → complete)

## **Client Communication & Request Triage**

### **Current Situation**

* Requests come in from 5+ channels: Tax Dome, email, phone, WhatsApp, and website direct — there is no central triage; everything runs through Kathy's brain  
* Kathy tracks the status of every client file, every request, signed-but-unpaid clients, and complex tax situations mentally  
* Finding the status of a file is hard; deadlines are not stored centrally; people are panicky during tax season; account logins are scattered across systems (QBO, Tax Dome, ATX, Gusto) and stored in LastPass

### **Improvement Opportunities**

* Triage all requests into one central hub — push over to actionable things  
* Connect phone number to a digital number to capture transcripts — then create actionables from the transcripts and populate a PM tool  
* Make a single source of truth (SSOT) for file status — store deadlines centrally, show logins for each client ("what accounts do we have for this person?")  
* Flag good vs. bad clients via response times and choice of words

### **Key KPIs & Dashboards**

* **KPIs:** Average request response time, number of unresolved requests per channel, stale intake count, percentage of clients flagged as "slow responders"  
* **Dashboards:** Unified request inbox with triage status; client file status board (SSOT); client quality score

## **Owner Operations (Kathy's Day-to-Day)**

### **Current Situation**

* Kathy gets interrupted for: systems going down, supply requests, office maintenance decisions, complex tax situations, ATX rollover questions — all "bug Kathy" regardless of severity  
* She works from home office while the team is at the physical office; WhatsApp is the internal comms channel  
* Team has lack of confidence (e.g., when rolling over a client on ATX, the preparer didn't know which filing was correct — amended vs. original)

### **Improvement Opportunities**

* Reduce interruptions by creating decision frameworks and documented SOPs so the team doesn't need Kathy for routine decisions  
* Build team confidence through structured training and clear escalation paths

### **Key KPIs & Dashboards**

* **KPIs:** Number of escalations to Kathy per week, percentage of decisions made without Kathy, team confidence score  
* **Dashboards:** Escalation tracker; decision log

**Initiatives**

## **Initiative 1: Single Source of Truth (Internal AlfaOS)**

**Problem Faced:**

* Client file status, deadlines, request intake, and account logins are scattered across Tax Dome, QBO, ATX, Gusto, LastPass, WhatsApp, email, phone, and Kathy's brain  
* No one can answer "what is the status of this client?" without asking Kathy  
* Paper-based intake during busy season means information is lost before it reaches any digital system  
* Requests come from 5+ channels with no central triage

**Proposed Solution:**

* Build an internal operating hub (AlfaOS) as the single source of truth for all client files, statuses, deadlines, and account information  
* Centralize request intake from all channels (Tax Dome, email, phone, WhatsApp, website) into one triage queue with automated routing  
* Digitize paper intake via tablet-based forms that flow directly into the system  
* Store client logins, EINs, formation info, and key documents in searchable client profiles  
* Track every intake with statuses: filed, canceled, completed, extended, blocked

**Value:**

* System remembers every client, every file status, and every deadline — Kathy's brain is no longer the only source of truth  
* During busy season, 10 walk-ins get immediately tracked with full visibility  
* New hires can look up any client's complete history, status, and account information without asking anyone  
* Global search for EIN, business name, or client instantly surfaces the full profile

## **Initiative 2: Executive Visibility & Real-Time Assurance**

**Problem Faced:**

* Kathy has no way to see "is everything on track" without manually checking each system  
* Stale intakes go unnoticed; pending clients waiting on documents have no automated follow-up  
* During tax season, people are panicky because deadlines and file statuses aren't visible  
* No way to flag client quality or see which clients are slow responders

**Proposed Solution:**

* Build dashboards showing live status of every tax return, bookkeeping client, and advisory engagement across the full pipeline  
* Create a "stale intake" alert system that surfaces files that haven't moved in X days  
* Flag client quality (good vs. bad) based on response times and communication patterns  
* Real-time deadline tracker with early warning signals for at-risk filings  
* Sales velocity dashboard: how many intakes recorded, status of each, conversion rates

**Value:**

* Kathy can see the health of the entire business in one view without checking individual systems  
* Risks surface before clients notice — no more panicky tax season surprises  
* Client quality flagging protects the ICP standards (organized, fast-responding clients) and helps prioritize who gets attention

## **Initiative 3: Team Execution**

**Problem Faced:**

* The team lacks confidence to make decisions independently (e.g., which ATX filing is correct, which deductions to apply)  
* Every non-routine situation escalates to Kathy: systems down, supplies, office maintenance, complex tax questions, ATX rollovers  
* No structured QA process means Kathy must review every return — she always finds improvements, which reinforces the dependency

**Proposed Solution:**

* Build a QA checklist/framework that mirrors Kathy's review process so preparers can self-check before escalating  
* Tag clients by complexity level — simple returns get reviewed by senior team members (not Kathy), complex ones escalate to Kathy  
* Create decision frameworks and SOPs for common escalation types (ATX rollovers, missing documents, system issues)  
* Personal dashboard for each team member showing their assigned returns, next steps, and blockers  
* AI scan to confirm what information is complete vs. missing before a return moves to review

**Value:**

* Kathy is freed from reviewing simple returns — the QA system catches what she would catch  
* Team builds confidence because they have clear frameworks, not guesswork  
* Work moves forward without waiting for Kathy to be available — the offshore team can take on more volume

## **Initiative 4: Executive Intelligence**

**Problem Faced:**

* No way to analyze advisory clients systematically — Kathy manually reviews 2 years of returns and financials, checks industry averages, and searches for patterns  
* Transaction volume per client isn't tracked, making it hard to quote accurately or determine categorization frequency  
* No automated way to parse financials for chart of accounts issues or flag deduction opportunities

**Proposed Solution:**

* AI-powered tax return analysis skill: input a return and financial statements, get recommendations based on first principles of tax analysis, legal structure, and industry averages  
* Track transaction volume per client (small, medium, large) and use it for quoting and workload planning  
* Parse transactions automatically and flag chart of accounts issues (e.g., if a purchase is of a certain type, it implies other classifications)  
* Connect to tax planning data sources to surface recommendations based on previous returns

**Value:**

* Advisory engagements are prepared faster and more thoroughly — Kathy's expertise is amplified, not replaced  
* Quoting for bookkeeping clients is data-driven based on actual transaction volume  
* The system explains what it's finding, making the analysis consistent whether it's Kathy or a trained team member

## **Initiative 5: Client Activation & Experience**

**Problem Faced:**

* Clients don't have visibility into where their tax return or bookkeeping stands — they have to ask Kathy  
* The onboarding experience varies: in-person clients fill paper forms, virtual clients use Tax Dome, older clients just call  
* Pending clients waiting on documents have no automated follow-up or self-service way to see what's needed

**Proposed Solution:**

* AI-guided onboarding flow for each client type: asks the right questions ("How many bank accounts do you have?", org type), trains on required documents, builds a custom scope/quote  
* Automated follow-up for pending documents with clear status visible to the client  
* Standardized digital intake regardless of channel — tablet for in-person, Tax Dome for virtual, with the same data flowing to the same system  
* Client-facing status view so they can see where their return or bookkeeping stands without calling

**Value:**

* Clients feel informed and in control — fewer "what's the status?" calls to Kathy and Carmen  
* Onboarding is consistent and complete — no missing information because the guided flow ensures all questions are answered  
* Renewals and upsells (bookkeeping → advisory) become natural because clients see the value of the organized relationship

## **Initiative 6: People & Culture**

**Problem Faced:**

* Team members lack confidence to make independent decisions — preparers don't know which ATX filing type is correct (amended vs. original), and routine questions escalate to Kathy instead of being resolved locally  
* No documented SOPs for common processes — tax intake steps, ATX rollover procedures, document follow-up sequences, and bookkeeping onboarding all live in Kathy's head or are learned by watching  
* New hires (including seasonal temp tax workers) have no structured ramp-up path — they shadow Kathy or ask questions as they go, which slows both parties down  
* Offshore teams (DJ's tax team, Simiran's bookkeeping team) operate with informal handoff processes — authorization forms, scope boundaries, and escalation paths aren't standardized  
* Bilingual capacity is critical for the San Antonio market but depends entirely on Carmen being available — no backup or documented scripts for Spanish-speaking client interactions

**Proposed Solution:**

* Document the core SOPs for each process: tax intake (in-person and virtual), ATX data entry and rollover, bookkeeping onboarding, document follow-up sequences, and business formation steps  
* Create decision frameworks for the top escalation types so the team can resolve them without Kathy — "which filing type?", "client says they're missing a document", "system is down", "client wants to add a service"  
* Build a structured onboarding checklist for new hires and seasonal workers — what to learn in week 1, 2, 3, who to shadow, which clients to start with  
* Standardize offshore team handoffs with clear scope documents, authorization requirements, and escalation triggers  
* Cross-train at least one additional team member on Spanish-speaking client interactions to reduce single-point-of-failure on Carmen

**Value:**

* The team stops guessing and starts executing — routine decisions happen without Kathy, freeing her for advisory and complex reviews  
* Seasonal workers ramp up in days instead of weeks, which is critical when tax season hits and volume spikes  
* Offshore teams operate with clear boundaries, reducing back-and-forth and increasing the volume of work Kathy can confidently delegate  
* The business becomes less fragile — knowledge lives in the system, not in any one person's head

## **Initiative 7: Automation & System Integration**

**Problem Faced:**

* Tax Dome and ATX don't integrate — Jacob manually copies data between them for every single return  
* Checks, Amazon orders, and bulk orders require manual categorization in QBO with no OCR or automation  
* Phone calls generate requests that are never captured digitally — no transcript, no actionable items created

**Proposed Solution:**

* Automate data transfer from Tax Dome to ATX (or equivalent tax prep software) to eliminate manual copy-paste  
* Implement OCR for checks to auto-categorize and reduce manual bookkeeping review  
* Connect phone number to a digital system to capture call transcripts, then auto-generate actionable items and populate the PM tool  
* AI helper tool to find possible deduction opportunities during tax prep — supplement what ATX catches

**Value:**

* Jacob's time shifts from data entry to higher-value work; every return processes faster  
* Bookkeeping categorization speed increases; manual review is reserved for genuinely ambiguous transactions  
* Phone-based requests stop falling through the cracks — every conversation becomes a tracked action item
